## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has become a global hotspot for the spread of the virus. There is a great need to be able to visualize the spread of the virus in the United States and across the globe. This will help the masses understand the spread of the virus as well as the regions that are affected the most. This application is designed to visualize the spread of the virus in the United States. The application makes use of the [Covid Act Now API](https://apidocs.covidactnow.org/api). The application is designed to be used in any browser.
## üßê Technical Description <a name = "Technical Description"></a>

The task is Front-End inclined involving the use if React Js , a REST API, Material-UI, and a Google Map. The choice of React Js was made because it is a library that is easy to use and is very popular. 
## üßê Trade Offs <a name = "Trade Offs"></a>
The application requirements outlined in the test have been met in my implementation. However, as with any software, there are trade offs that need to be considered. The trade offs are as follows:
- The Covid Act Now API does not provide the coordinates of the USA States (lat,lng) in the response. This is a limitation of the API. As a result, I had to get that data elsewhere.
The coordinates data set might not be very accurate and some of the states might not be represented in the dataset
## üßê Future Improvements <a name = "Improvements"></a>
Some of the future improvements that I would like to make are:
- The application is not fully optimized for mobile devices
- One the user searches/filters for a specific state, I'd like to be able to zoom in on that state
- The UI could be improved in several ways
    - including pie charts & bar graphs in the visualization
    - improving the overall look & feel of the application
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
